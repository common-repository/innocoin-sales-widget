Start earning revenue with the Innocoin widget on your weblog. 50% of the profit goes directly to your bitcoin address.

== Description ==

Innocoin makes it possible for you to offer our sales widgets on your weblog. A visitor can then buy/sell crypto currencies on your weblog. We share the profits with you 50/50.

You can make a list of preconfigured widgets with different sizes, themes and colors and publish each of them in your blog posts and/or in the sidebar.

When a visitor places an order through the widget on your site, 50% of the profit will go directly to your (specified) bitcoin address.

The widget converts better if you write content to support it, for example a manual on how to use the widget or how to install the Mist browser and how to make purchases. Also try to optimize your site for search engines.
